# Group Etiquette

## Be Relevant

Posting is strict at AIDL. Please be **relevant, accurate and noncommercial**. Commercial posts are only allowed on Saturday, which is defined by [Eastern Time](https://time.is/cs/ET). If you don't follow this rule, you might be banned. In case you are not sure how a good blog post should look like, check out [Posting On AIDL](http://thegrandjanitor.com/2017/01/26/posting-on-aidl/).

## What Not to Write

We **automatically delete** posts that are:
- Re-posts from a page,
- Re-post of an article which is already posted,
- Copyrighted material, unless the author explicitly release the content

**Except for Saturdays** we delete posts that are:
- Promotion of another group, Facebook or similar,
- Promotion of conferences, events or products,
- Job recruitment or solicitation,
- Brand promotion: notice that any mentioning with your company name and brand within your post counted as a promotion.

Anything that is **already answered**:
- Questions that are answered in this Knowledge Base, e.g. "How do I learn deep learning or AI?"
- Questions which can be answered easily by Googling

## Group Related Questions

### Thanking for Acceptance

In case you are wondering why your "Thank you for acceptance" message has been instantly closed, before you're going to send us series of hand-picked angry emojis, just think about it. Our group with thousands of people can't manage to welcome every new member individually. And as an older member, imagine you'd read 50 thousands of "thank you" messages or more. That doesn't seem very enriching, right?

### Filtering Out Beginner Questions

If you believe that other members are often asking boring questions, such as "How do I start at AI, ML, ANN..." and you'd like to filter these out, we'd like you to just stop for a minute and think about it.

We are happy to spread knowledge of AI and deep learning to everyone in the world. And we believe that it's important to be nice to beginners. There's a saying: 5 minutes before you learn something, you don't know something.

If someone asks a question that has been already solved, just say them:

*"Please take a look at this Knowledge Base part, you should have tons of ideas after reading them."*
