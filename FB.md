# Group Etiquette

## Be Relevant
**Be relevant, accurate and noncommercial** is all you need to know when posting at AIDL. Commercial posts are only allowed on Saturday, which ends and starts as in [Eastern Time Zone](https://time.is/cs/ET) (UTC-5).

If you don't follow this rule, you might be banned. In case you are not sure how a great blog post should look like, check out [Posting On AIDL](http://thegrandjanitor.com/2017/01/26/posting-on-aidl/).

## What Not to Write
**Already answered** questions, that are:
- In the Knowledge Base,
- Easily solved by Googling.

We automatically delete posts that are:
- Re-posts,
- Copyrighted material.

Except for Saturdays we delete posts that are:
- Promotions of another group, conference, event, product or a brand,
- Job recruitment or solicitation.

## Group Related Questions

### Thanking for Acceptance
We are instantly closing "Thank you for acceptance" posts. As our group with thousands of people can't manage to welcome every new member and for a future clearer orientation between content, we suggest you not to write those. And of course, we are happy you are here.

### Filtering Out Beginner Questions
If you believe that other members are often asking repetitive or dull questions and you'd like to filter these out, we'd like you to just stop for a minute and think about it. We are happy to spread knowledge of AI and deep learning to everyone in the world. We believe that it's important to be kind to beginners. And the solution here is easy, check out if Knowledge Base has answered it already and link it.

### Think and Google Before You Post
Before you ask your question, such as:
* Use Technique X with Language Y
* Explain Concept X, List 3 Properties of Concept Y
* Find an Idea for My AI Project, FYP, Thesis, and Competition

Always check out if you took enough time googling because there's a possibility someone already solved it. Searching on Github could help also.

We are sorry, but we can't do your homework for you. Don't be lazy. Coming up with an idea is part of the training no matter if you are doing a project, writing a thesis or joining a competition. Partially it would be cheating if we are the one who comes up with the idea for you.

But of course, if you've spent some time already googling the internets through, try to ask the question as thoroughly, yet clearly, as you can.
