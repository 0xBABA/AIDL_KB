# Group Etiquette

## Be Relevant

Posting is strict at AIDL. Please be **relevant, accurate and noncommercial**. Commercial posts are only allowed on Saturday, which is defined by [Eastern Time](https://time.is/cs/ET). If you don't follow this rule, you might be banned. In case you are not sure how a good blog post should look like, check out [Posting On AIDL](http://thegrandjanitor.com/2017/01/26/posting-on-aidl/).

## What Not to Write

We **automatically delete** posts that are:
- Re-posts from a page,
- Re-post of an article which is already posted,
- Copyrighted material, unless the author explicitly release the content

**Except for Saturdays** we delete posts that are:
- Promotion of another group, Facebook or similar,
- Promotion of conferences, events or products,
- Job recruitment or solicitation,
- Brand promotion: notice that any mentioning with your company name and brand within your post counted as a promotion.

Anything that is **already answered**:
- Questions that are answered in this Knowledge Base, e.g. "How do I learn deep learning or AI?"
- Questions which can be answered easily by Googling

## Group Related Questions

### Thanking for Acceptance

In case you are wondering why your "Thank you for acceptance" message has been instantly closed, before you're going to send us series of hand-picked angry emojis, just think about it. Our group with thousands of people can't manage to welcome every new member individually. And as an older member, imagine you'd read 50 thousands of "thank you" messages or more. That doesn't seem very enriching, right?

### Filtering Out Beginner Questions

If you believe that other members are often asking boring questions, such as "How do I start at AI, ML, ANN..." and you'd like to filter these out, we'd like you to just stop for a minute and think about it.

We are happy to spread knowledge of AI and deep learning to everyone in the world. And we believe that it's important to be nice to beginners. There's a saying: 5 minutes before you learn something, you don't know something.

If someone asks a question that has been already solved, just say them:

*"Please take a look at this Knowledge Base part, you should have tons of ideas after reading them."*

## Repeating Questions

## Use Technique X with Language Y?
It seems obvious, yet some of the questions that can easily be solved by Google are still being asked. No matter how unique problem are you solving, there's always a great possibility someone was trying to solve it before you and that somewhere out there could already be multiple source codes concerning machine learning technique in your selected programming language. It's always good to try to search Github also.

## Explain Concept X, List 3 Properties of Concept Y
Try to Google it also. We are sorry, but we can't do your homework for you. And of course, if you've spent some time already googling the internets through, try to ask the question as thoroughly, yet simply, as you can. Add more context if needed. And of course, if you couldn't Google the term, it's fair to ask questions, we won't bite you.

## Find an Idea for My AI Project, FYP, Thesis and Competition
Firstly, don't be lazy. Coming up with an idea is part of the training if you decide to do a project, FYP, or write a thesis, or join a competition. In fact, if you decide to join an AI competition, it will be cheating if we are the ones who come up with the idea.

But it's legit to ask *how you can come up with ideas*. Usually, there are two ways:

1. Go to check out other people's idea, then twist it.
2. Go to solve a problem that you feel about. e.g. a lot of science project winners won because their loved ones have diseases. And a deep learning-based approach helps the process to diagnose the problem.

If you are out of ideas, then consider few things:

1. Ask smarter people what inspire them to come up with an idea.
2. Read a lot.
3. Don't work on a technical problem for a while and do some artsy stuff.

All three methods can give you a lot of inspirations.
