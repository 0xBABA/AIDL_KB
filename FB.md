# Group Etiquette

## Be Relevant

Posting is strict at AIDL. Please be **relevant, accurate and noncommercial**. Commercial posts are only allowed on Saturday, which is defined by [Eastern Time](https://time.is/cs/ET). If you don't follow this rule, you might be banned. In case you are not sure how a good blog post should look like, check out [Posting On AIDL](http://thegrandjanitor.com/2017/01/26/posting-on-aidl/).

## What Not to Write
Questions that are **already answered**:
- In the Knowledge Base, e.g. "How do I learn deep learning or AI?"
- Which can be answered easily by Googling.

We **automatically delete** posts that are:
- Re-posts,
- Copyrighted material, unless the author explicitly releases the content.

**Except for Saturdays** we delete posts that are:
- Promotions of another group, conference, event, product or a brand,
- Job recruitment or solicitation.

## Group Related Questions

### Thanking for Acceptance
We are instantly closing "Thank you for acceptance" posts. As our group with thousands of people can't manage to welcome every new member and for a future easier orientation between posts, we suggest you not to write those. And of course, we are happy you are here.

### Filtering Out Beginner Questions
If you believe that other members are often asking boring questions, such as "How do I start at AI, ML, ANN..." and you'd like to filter these out, we'd like you to just stop for a minute and think about it. We are happy to spread knowledge of AI and deep learning to everyone in the world. And we believe that it's important to be nice to beginners. So if you see a question that has been already solved, just  say them: *"Please take a look at this Knowledge Base part, you should have tons of ideas after reading them."*

## Repeating Questions
<!-- NOTE: answers here are too aggresive and they aren't much helpful either, mostly saying "just google", maybe consider not having them here -->

### Use Technique X with Language Y?
It seems obvious, yet some of the questions that can easily be solved by Google are still being asked. No matter how unique problem are you solving, there's always a great possibility someone was trying to solve it before you and that somewhere out there could already be multiple source codes concerning machine learning technique in your selected programming language. It's always good to try to search Github also.

### Explain Concept X, List 3 Properties of Concept Y
We are sorry, but we can't do your homework for you. But of course, if you've spent some time already googling the internets through, try to ask the question as thoroughly, yet simply, as you can. Add more context if needed. And of course, if you couldn't Google the term, it's fair to ask questions, we won't bite you.

### Find an Idea for My AI Project, FYP, Thesis and Competition
Firstly, don't be lazy. Coming up with an idea is part of the training if you decide to do a project, FYP, or write a thesis, or join a competition. In fact, if you decide to join an AI competition, it will be cheating if we are the ones who come up with the idea.

But it's legit to ask *how you can come up with ideas*. Usually, there are two ways:

1. Go to check out other people's idea, then twist it.
2. Go to solve a problem that you feel about. e.g. a lot of science project winners won because their loved ones have diseases. And a deep learning-based approach helps the process to diagnose the problem.

If you are out of ideas, then consider few things:

1. Ask smarter people what inspire them to come up with an idea.
2. Read a lot.
3. Don't work on a technical problem for a while and do some artsy stuff.

All three methods can give you a lot of inspiration.
