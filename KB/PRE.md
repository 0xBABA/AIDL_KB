# Prerequisites

For Machine Learning mostly **Linear Algebra** and **Calculus I-III** are needed. In Linear Algebra, you should be good at eigenvectors and matrix operation. In Calculus, you should be quite comfortable with differentiation. You might also want to have a primer on matrix differentiation before you start because it's a topic which is seldom touched in an undergraduate curriculum.

Some people are also arguing that Topology is important and having a Physics and Biology background could help. But they are not crucial to start.
