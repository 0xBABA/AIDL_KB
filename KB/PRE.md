# Prerequisites
For Machine Learning mostly **Linear Algebra** and **Calculus I-III** are needed. In Linear Algebra, you should be good at eigenvectors and matrix operation. In Calculus, you should be quite comfortable with differentiation. You might also want to have a primer on matrix differentiation before you start because it's a topic which is seldom touched in an undergraduate curriculum.

For being able to apply Math in case of Machine Learning, you'll also need to know basic programming, there's no recommended programming language, as you'll probably need to [switch between languages from time to time](AIDL_KB/BAS.md#recommended-programming-language).

Some people are also arguing that Topology is important and having a Physics and Biology background could help. But they are not crucial to start.
