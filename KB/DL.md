# Deep Learning (DL)
We recommend to firstly start with one or two [Machine Learning classes](ML.md), because Deep Learning is related to them and it will be easier for you.

## Courses
* The most recommended is [Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai class](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)

## Recommended resources
* [Geoffrey Hinton's](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/nntut.html)
* [Andrew Karpathay's](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/)
* [Richard Socher's](http://www.socher.org/)
* [Hugo Larochelle's](https://research.google.com/pubs/105144.html)
* [Nando de Freitas'](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/)

### Capsule Networks
* [Aurélien Géron's tutorial](https://youtu.be/pPN8d0E3900)

## Books
* [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/), Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville, Free
* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/), Michael Nielsen, Free

## Scientific Papers
* The most cited
  * [Understanding, Generalization, Transfer](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers#understanding--generalization--transfer)
