# Deep Learning (DL)
We recommend to firstly start with one or two [Machine Learning classes](ML.md), because Deep Learning is related to them and it will be easier for you.

## Courses
* The most recommended is [Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai class](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)

## Recommended resources
* [Geoffrey Hinton's](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/nntut.html)
* [Andrew Karpathay's](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/)
* [Richard Socher's](http://www.socher.org/)
* [Hugo Larochelle's](https://research.google.com/pubs/105144.html)
* [Nando de Freitas'](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/)

If you don't know which DL library to start with, we suggest you check [Ranking Popular DL Libraries](https://blog.thedataincubator.com/2017/10/ranking-popular-deep-learning-libraries-for-data-science/) from 10/2017 where the winner is [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), followed by [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/).

## Curated Lists
* [A guide to DL](http://yerevann.com/a-guide-to-deep-learning/) is very handy because all concepts are ranked by its difficulty
* [Awesome DL](https://github.com/ChristosChristofidis/awesome-deep-learning)

## Books
* [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/), Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville, Free
* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/), Michael Nielsen, Free

## Scientific Papers
* The most cited
  * [Understanding, Generalization, Transfer](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers#understanding--generalization--transfer)
  * [Optimization, Training Techniques](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers#optimization--training-techniques)
  * [Unsupervised, Generative Models](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers#unsupervised--generative-models)
  * [Convolutional Network Models](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers#convolutional-neural-network-models)
