# Computer Vision (CV)

* Momentarily the most recommended resource for Deep Learning on Computer Vision is the [cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), most of the other resources are either derivative or have glaring problems.
* One other course which is good is the Udacity free [Introduction to Computer Vision Course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud810) it is the same course taught at Georgia Tech Master curriculum. The course has assignments in Octave/Matlab.
