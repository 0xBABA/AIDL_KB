### Brain as a Computer
"Does human brain work like a computer or not?" has the rather complicated answer. And with certainty, it's not possible to answer it with current knowledge. It's also good to mention that Artificial Neural Networks are inspired by Biological Neural Networks, therefore they could possibly simulate them, although with current technology it's [still very inefficient](http://agi-roadmap.sablatura.info/).

It's recommended to read [Robert Epstein's post](https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer) that looking at the brain as a computer is wrong, followed by counterarguments such as [Perengras's](http://lukependergrass.work/blog/the-information-processing-brain) (followed by [Golder's review of both](https://medium.com/@gdoteof/a-response-to-a-response-to-the-empty-brain-the-information-processing-brain-dde4c6d3aecd)), [Shallit's](http://recursed.blogspot.com/2016/05/yes-your-brain-certainly-is-computer.html) and [Graziosi's](https://sergiograziosi.wordpress.com/2016/05/22/robert-epsteins-empty-essay/).

### Mathematical Models of a Neuron
**Lebedev and Lutsky** ([1972](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Physiology%20of%20movements%20and%20activity&author=NA.%20Bernstein&publication_year=1990)) pioneered the concept of modeling the dynamics of neurons on the basis of equations with delay. Generally, researchers agree that it is not necessary to introduce delay in explicit form into equations that describe the neuron. In examining the fundamental role of delays in neuron modeling, **Hodgkin and Huxley** ([1939](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Models%20of%20neural%20dynamics%20in%20brain%20information%20processing%E2%80%94Results%20of%20%E2%80%9Cdecade%E2%80%9D&author=GN.%20Borisyuk&author=RM.%20Borisyuk&author=YB.%20Kazanovich&author=GR.%20Ivanitsky&journal=UFMN&volume=172&issue=10&pages=1189-1214&publication_year=2002)) achieved the effect of delay through the use of a chain of ordinary differential equations. A model always reflects the interpretation of a phenomenon; simultaneously, some aspects are taken for granted while some others are typically ignored. The purposes of modeling also differ. Some models are used to study processes taking place inside the object under examination; others are used to explain the relationship of objects to each other. The neuron is a complex formation, and it is difficult to expect the monotony of representations. In our view, a variety of mathematical models of neurons can be divided into two classes: static and dynamic. – Citation (simplified) from [The Model of a Single Neuron](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-19866-8_1), Serguey Kashchenko, last updated 2015

### Motor Control
(Low-level) motor control is the process by which humans and animals use their brain/cognition to activate and coordinate the muscles and limbs involved in the performance of a motor skill. Fundamentally, it is the integration of sensory information, both about the world and the current state of the body, to determine the appropriate set of muscle forces and joint activations to generate some desired movement or action. This process requires cooperative interaction between the central nervous system and the musculoskeletal system, and is thus a problem of information processing, coordination, mechanics, physics, and cognition. Successful motor control is crucial to interacting with the world, not only determining action capabilities, but regulating balance and stability as well. – Citation from [Motor Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_control)

#### Notes
* Majority of human **fingers and toes are replaceable** and theoretically redundant. From 5 toes per a leg, Homo Sapiens would be able to move without all of them, although [toes play the role in the effectivity of movement](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature03052). Speaking about fingers, [three are necessary for object manipulation](https://blog.robotiq.com/why-use-a-robot-gripper-with-3-fingers) if at least one is in the opposition.
