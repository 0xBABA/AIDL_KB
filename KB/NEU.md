### Memory
[Most to date memory model](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Memory) with possibilities:
* Protein synthesis possibly plays a role
  * [The role of protein synthesis in memory consolidation: Progress amid decades of debate](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.nlm.2007.09.010)
  * [Protein synthesis is associated with high-speed dynamics and broad-band stability of functional hubs in the brain](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.neuroimage.2017.04.062)
* Memory formation possibly happens due to engram competition
  * [Competition between engrams influences fear memory formation and recall](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aaf0594)
