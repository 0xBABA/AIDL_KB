### Psychological Theories of Memory
<!-- Keywords: Atkinson & Shiffrin, Baddeley model. Mental representation of knowledge. Episodic memory. Autobiographic memory. Excellent memory performance.
Implicit and explicit processes, examples. Implicit/explicit/automatic processing and consciousness. Artificial grammars. -->

[Most to date memory model](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Memory) with potential upcoming updates:
* Protein synthesis possibly plays a role
  * [The role of protein synthesis in memory consolidation: Progress amid decades of debate](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.nlm.2007.09.010)
  * [Protein synthesis is associated with high-speed dynamics and broad-band stability of functional hubs in the brain](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.neuroimage.2017.04.062)
* Memory formation possibly happens due to engram competition
  * [Competition between engrams influences fear memory formation and recall](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aaf0594)

## Brain as Computer
"Does human brain work like a computer or not?" has the rather complicated answer. And with certainty, it's not possible to answer it with current knowledge. It's also good to mention that Artificial Neural Networks are inspired by Biological Neural Networks, therefore they could possibly simulate them, although with current technology it's [still very inefficient](http://agi-roadmap.sablatura.info/).

It's recommended to read [Robert Epstein's post](https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer) that looking at the brain as a computer is wrong, followed by counterarguments such as [Perengras's](http://lukependergrass.work/blog/the-information-processing-brain) (followed by [Golder's review of both](https://medium.com/@gdoteof/a-response-to-a-response-to-the-empty-brain-the-information-processing-brain-dde4c6d3aecd)), [Shallit's](http://recursed.blogspot.com/2016/05/yes-your-brain-certainly-is-computer.html) and [Graziosi's](https://sergiograziosi.wordpress.com/2016/05/22/robert-epsteins-empty-essay/).
