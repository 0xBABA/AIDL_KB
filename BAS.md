# How To Learn & Basics

Are you asking yourself "How do I start in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning or Deep Learning"?

In short, just iterate **three steps** mentioned here until you'll become professional or you'll get your Nobel Price in AI. For even more thorough info, Arthur Chan has made [an article how to start learning](http://thegrandjanitor.com/2016/08/15/learning-deep-learning-my-top-five-resource/) AI&DL.

## Step 1: Math and Programming
For even being able to start with, there's a necessity of having some background in Mathematics (such as linear algebra, probability, statistics and calculus) and being able to understand basic programming, as AI, ML or DL are based on both of them.

The most liked resource on Mathematics in our group is [MIT course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-657-mathematics-of-machine-learning-fall-2015/lecture-notes/MIT18_657F15_LecNote.pdf).

## Step 2: Online Classes
Check where to start learning [Machine Learning](#ml-machine-learning) and [Deep Learning](#dl-deep-learning) in this Knowledge Base.

## Step 3: Solve a Problem
Find a problem concerning this topic to play with and solve it. If you have no idea what problem to find, try [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).


# Frequently Asked Questions

## The difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning

Many people would lead you to believe it is a [matter of opinion](http://thegrandjanitor.com/2017/07/09/what-is-the-difference-between-deep-and-machine-learning/). But by definition Deep Learning should be part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms.

## I'm Bad at Math or Programming. Can I still learn it?
Mostly you can tag along, but at a certain point, if you don't understand the underlying Math, you won't be able to understand what you are doing. Same for programming, if you never implement one, or trace one yourself, you will never truly understand why an algorithm behaves a certain way.

So what if you feel you are bad at Math? Don't beat yourself too much. Take [Barbara Oakley's class on Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), you will learn more about tough subjects such as Mathematics, Physics, and Programming.

## Recommended Programming Language
In general, if you are working on a computer, you will need to switch between languages from time to time. So arguing about which language is better is not a wise thing. If we want to give the best advice, perhaps the answer is you should just learn as many of them as possible.

Of course, your time is limited. So AIDL usually recommends Python as your first choice. Python is cited as a good language for AI/DL because it has the best support of libraries. Most ML libraries from python links with C/C++. So you get the best of both flexibility and speed.

Other also cites [Java](https://deeplearning4j.org/), [Lua](http://torch.ch/), Lisp, Golang or R. It really depends on your purpose. Practical concerns such as code integration, your familiarity with a language usually dictate your choice. R deserves special mention because it was widely used in some brother fields such as data science and it is gaining popularity.

Finally, there is Matlab/Octave, it is also useful to learn because many Coursera ML's classes are Matlab-based. For example [Andrew Ng's class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and Geoffrey Hinton's class. Sure, you can finish them in Python, but you will be forced to a lot of re-implementation in the process.
