# AI&DL Knowledge Base

This knowledge base is a curated list that is related to [the Facebook Group about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DeepNetGroup/), in the abbreviated form AI&DL or AIDL. It's basically a more complex version of **Frequently Asked Questions** (FAQ).

As [AIDL Facebook community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DeepNetGroup/) is in the simplicity **one big forum** with currently more than 60 thousands users where the main content is the discussion about all themes concerning Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, we want to keep the repeating questions outside the group, as the answers to these questions are similarly repeating, being itself an unnecessary noise in the group and preventing members from focusing on other things.

If you'd like to find info that's not discussion related, you can try other AI content we publish:

## Frequently Asked Questions


### How To Learn

Are you asking yourself "How do I start in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning or Deep Learning"?

In short, just iterate **three steps** mentioned here until you'll become professional or you'll get your Nobel Price in AI. For even more thorough info, Arthur Chan has made [an article how to start learning](http://thegrandjanitor.com/2016/08/15/learning-deep-learning-my-top-five-resource/) AI&DL.

#### Step 1: Math and Programming
For even being able to start with, there's a necessity of having some background in Mathematics (such as linear algebra, probability, statistics and calculus) and being able to understand basic programming, as AI, ML or DL are based on both of them.

The most liked resource on Mathematics in our group is [MIT course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-657-mathematics-of-machine-learning-fall-2015/lecture-notes/MIT18_657F15_LecNote.pdf).

#### Step 2: Online Classes
Check where to start learning [Machine Learning](#where--to--learn) and [Deep Learning](#where--to--learn) in this Knowledge Base.

#### Step 3: Solve a Problem
Find a problem concerning this topic to play with and solve it. If you have no idea what problem to find, try [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

### Where To Learn

#### Prerequisites
For Machine Learning mostly **Linear Algebra** and **Calculus I-III** are needed. In Linear Algebra, you should be good at eigenvectors and matrix operation. In Calculus, you should be quite comfortable with differentiation. You might also want to have a primer on matrix differentiation before you start because it's a topic which is seldom touched in an undergraduate curriculum.

Some people are also arguing that Topology is important and having a Physics and Biology background could help. But they are not crucial to start.

#### Machine Learning
##### Classes
The most cited and recommended is [online course is from Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). Followed by [CalTech edX class](https://www.edx.org/course/learning-data-introductory-machine-caltechx-cs1156x-0) and [UW Coursera Class specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning). If that's too difficult for you, you can try [beginner Udacity courses](https://www.udacity.com/courses/machine-learning).

##### Books
Many links you will see online are actually filled with non-free contents. Of course, you also want to download books legally. Here are honorable mentions: [10 Free Must-Read Books](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/04/10-free-must-read-books-machine-learning-data-science.html) followed with [60 Data Science Books](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/09/free-data-science-books.html). There's also [William Z. Chen curated list](http://www.wzchen.com/data-science-books/), [Michael Nielsen's ebook](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) or Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville's [Deep Learning's ebook](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/).

#### Deep Learning
Firstly start with one or two Machine Learning classes, because Deep Learning is related to them and it will be easier for you. Then we recommend you checking [Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai class](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). Then check all the [Geoffrey Hinton's resources](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/nntut.html), [Andrew Karpathay's resources](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/), [Richard Socher's publications](http://www.socher.org/), [Hugo Larochelle's research](https://research.google.com/pubs/105144.html) and [Nando de Freitas' texts](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/). For Deep Reinforcement Learning check out [David Silver's videos](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) and [John Schulman's lectures](http://joschu.net/).

#### Computer Vision
Momentarily the most recommended resource for Deep Learning on Computer Vision is the [cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), most of the other resources are either derivative or have glaring problems.

#### Comparing Resources
How do you compare different resources on machine learning and deep learning? As mentioned before, there's an [Arthur Chan's article](http://thegrandjanitor.com/2016/08/15/learning-deep-learning-my-top-five-resource/) that's comparing different resources and their prerequisites. YerevaNN Lab has made [A guide to Deep Learning](http://yerevann.com/a-guide-to-deep-learning/) that is very handy for learning because all concepts are ranked by its difficulty. There also exists [A16Z AI playbook](http://aiplaybook.a16z.com/docs/reference/links), a list that completes the lists before, placing more focus on AI. [Reddit's Machine Learning FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/wiki/index) has another list of great resources.

#### Scientific Papers
There is a curated list from Terry Taewoong Um that [curates the most cited deep learning papers](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers) since 2012. There's also very thorough [list of survey papers on deeplearning.net](http://deeplearning.net/reading-list/).

#### Public Datasets
Take a look at the collection of the [Public Datasets related to Machine Learning from our members](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DeepNetGroup/permalink/394240667635488/).

### Understanding Concepts

#### Basics

##### The difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning

Many people would lead you to believe it is a [matter of opinion](http://thegrandjanitor.com/2017/07/09/what-is-the-difference-between-deep-and-machine-learning/). But by definition Deep Learning should be part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms.

#### I'm Bad at Math or Programming. Can I still learn it?
Mostly you can tag along, but at a certain point, if you don't understand the underlying Math, you won't be able to understand what you are doing. Same for programming, if you never implement one, or trace one yourself, you will never truly understand why an algorithm behaves a certain way.

So what if you feel you are bad at Math? Don't beat yourself too much. Take [Barbara Oakley's class on Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), you will learn more about tough subjects such as Mathematics, Physics, and Programming.

#### Recommended Programming Language
In general, if you are working on a computer, you will need to switch between languages from time to time. So arguing about which language is better is not a wise thing. If we want to give the best advice, perhaps the answer is you should just learn as many of them as possible.

Of course, your time is limited. So AIDL usually recommends Python as your first choice. Python is cited as a good language for AI/DL because it has the best support of libraries. Most ML libraries from python links with C/C++. So you get the best of both flexibility and speed.

Other also cites [Java](https://deeplearning4j.org/), [Lua](http://torch.ch/), Lisp, Golang or R. It really depends on your purpose. Practical concerns such as code integration, your familiarity with a language usually dictate your choice. R deserves special mention because it was widely used in some brother fields such as data science and it is gaining popularity.

Finally, there is Matlab/Octave, it is also useful to learn because many Coursera ML's classes are Matlab-based. For example [Andrew Ng's class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and Geoffrey Hinton's class. Sure, you can finish them in Python, but you will be forced to a lot of re-implementation in the process.

### How do I

#### Build a Chatbot

First of all, despite what people tell you, a machine doesn't really know how to respond like a human yet. It is a difficult problem. We can only tell you some approaches to go forward.

The first approach is to write a bunch of ifs, and then each of them gives users some answers. This result in programmer crafting a giant state machine-like structure of the program. There are many abstraction frameworks which helps you to create this kind of program much faster, you can try AIML for example. AIDL seldom put the focus on this kind of method, because it is mostly programming/lookup. And there is not many machine learning about it.

The second approach is to gather a bunch of question/answer pairs, then try to train a machine to learn it. You can use something like a neural network machine translation (NNMT) method or any translation models you like to train such a model. But then how do you come up with a good and relevant answer is tough. So that's why it is still a research topic.

You can think the second approach could be extended to many other use cases of DL, e.g. you can stuff a reading comprehension program and later it can answer the question. But then notice that you are still not solving the question of how to give natural and relevant dialogue.

#### Use Technique X with Language Y?
It seems obvious, yet some of the questions that can easily be solved by Google are still being asked. No matter how unique problem are you solving, there's always a great possibility someone was trying to solve it before you and that somewhere out there could already be multiple source codes concerning machine learning technique in your selected programming language. It's always good to try to search Github also.

#### Explain Concept X, List 3 Properties of Concept Y
Try to Google it also. We are sorry, but we can't do your homework for you. And of course, if you've spent some time already googling the internets through, try to ask the question as thoroughly, yet simply, as you can. Add more context if needed. And of course, if you couldn't Google the term, it's fair to ask questions, we won't bite you.

#### Find an Idea for My AI Project, FYP, Thesis and Competition
Firstly, don't be lazy. Coming up with an idea is part of the training if you decide to do a project, FYP, or write a thesis, or join a competition. In fact, if you decide to join an AI competition, it will be cheating if we are the ones who come up with the idea.

But it's legit to ask *how you can come up with ideas*. Usually, there are two ways:

1. Go to check out other people's idea, then twist it. 
2. Go to solve a problem that you feel about. e.g. a lot of science project winners won because their loved ones have diseases. And a deep learning-based approach helps the process to diagnose the problem.

If you are out of ideas, then consider few things:

1. Ask smarter people what inspire them to come up with an idea.
2. Read a lot.
3. Don't work on a technical problem for a while and do some artsy stuff.

All three methods can give you a lot of inspirations.

### Group Related Questions

#### Thanking for Acceptance

In case you are wondering why your "Thank you for acceptance" message has been instantly closed, before you're going to send us series of hand-picked angry emojis, just think about it. Our group with thousands of people can't manage to welcome every new member individually. And as an older member, imagine you'd read 50 thousands of "thank you" messages or more. That doesn't seem very enriching, right?


#### Filtering Out Beginner Questions

If you believe that other members are often asking boring questions, such as "How do I start at AI, ML, ANN..." and you'd like to filter these out, we'd like you to just stop for a minute and think about it.

We are happy to spread knowledge of AI and deep learning to everyone in the world. And we believe that it's important to be nice to beginners. There's a saying: 5 minutes before you learn something, you don't know something.

If someone asks a question that has been already solved, just say them: 

*"Please take a look at this Knowledge Base part, you should have tons of ideas after reading them."*

#### Joining AIDL Literature Discussion Subgroup
Hint: Rule 1 of AIDL-LD is *"If you don't read, you won't survive here for long."* It's also not recommended for beginners.
