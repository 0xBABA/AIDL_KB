# AI&DL Knowledge Base (AIDL_KB)

This knowledge base is a curated list that is related to [the Facebook Group about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DeepNetGroup/), in the abbreviated form AI&DL or AIDL.

The goals of AIDL_KB are,

* to serve as an alternative FAQ of [AIDL Facebook Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DeepNetGroup/) 's [pinned post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DeepNetGroup/permalink/385843868475168/).  We also hope that this FAQ is updatable over time.  You can also think of it as a more complex version of **Frequently Asked Questions** (FAQ).
* provide a Wikipedia style of knowledge base for all AIDL members and public.

Other contents published by AIDL staffs.

* [AIDL Weekly Newsletter](http://aidl.io/)
* [AIDL Office Hour](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3YM5TEbSqIpFGH85d6gjKg) Youtube channel

[TODO include]: <> (was Comparing Resources previously) How do you compare different resources on machine learning and deep learning? There's an [Arthur Chan's article](http://thegrandjanitor.com/2016/08/15/learning-deep-learning-my-top-five-resource/) that's comparing different resources and their prerequisites. YerevaNN Lab has made [A guide to Deep Learning](http://yerevann.com/a-guide-to-deep-learning/) that is very handy for learning because all concepts are ranked by its difficulty. There also exists [A16Z AI playbook](http://aiplaybook.a16z.com/docs/reference/links), a list that completes the lists before, placing more focus on AI. [Reddit's Machine Learning FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/wiki/index) has another list of great resources.
